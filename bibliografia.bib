Major concepts are illustrated with running examples, and major algorithms are illustrated by Pascal computer programs. No prior knowledge of GAs or genetics is assumed, and only a minimum of computer programming and mathematics background is required.}

  abstract  = {We report a theoretical investigation on the energy spectrum and the effective Zeeman energy (EZE) in monolayer \ch{MoS2} circular quantum dots, subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field. Interestingly, we observe the emergence of energy-locked modes, depending on the competition between the dot confinement and the applied magnetic field, for either the highest K-valley valence band or the lowest -valley conduction band. Moreover, an unusual dot-size-independent EZE behavior of the highest valence and the lowest conduction bands is found. Although the EZEs are insensitive to the variation of quantum confinement, both of them grow linearly with the magnetic field, similar to that in the monolayer MoS2 material. The EZEs along with their ‘robustness’ against dot confinements open opportunities of a universal magnetic control over the valley degree of freedom, for quantum dots of all sizes.}

On the basis of this a possible explanation of some of the observed characteristics of the class is tentatively suggested.}},

The property of quadratic termination has been replaced by one of monotonic convergence of the eigenvalues of the approximating matrix to the inverse hessian. A convex class of updating formulae which possess this property has been established, and a strategy has been indicated for choosing a member of the class so as to keep the approximation away from both singularity and unboundedness. A FORTRAN program has been tested extensively with encouraging results.}},
